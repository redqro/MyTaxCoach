                <p>You go to your mailbox, pull everything out, looking for something more exciting than junk mail, and there it is… an envelope with the return address “Internal Revenue Service” on it.<br><br>
                Your heart starts to race, and you break out in a sweat. You open it, and it’s a notice that the IRS is either questioning items on your tax return or you will be audited.<br><br>
                Worse yet, you discover someone stole your identity, filed a tax return in your name, and collected a fraudulent refund!
                You might wonder why you received the letter from the IRS in the first place since you have your tax returns prepared by a professional. The truth is that anyone is subject to the IRS's scrutiny for various reasons.<br><br>
                Of course, if we do make any error, we will correct the issue and take responsibility for any penalties or actions with the IRS.</p>

                <h2 class="care-title">Here are the facts</h2>
                <p>The IRS sent out more than 14 million automated notices last year.<br><br>
                When you receive a letter from the IRS, they will claim you owe them money or claim you didn’t report something correctly, which you will have to defend because, with the IRS, you are guilty until proven innocent.<br><br>
                They have the power to levy your bank accounts and garnish your wages without a court order!</p>

            <p>With our Audit Protection Plan, we’ll protect you from ever having to deal with the tax authorities alone if you get a notice from the IRS.<br><br>
            And if you are ever summoned to meet with an IRS agent in person, we’ll attend on your behalf!<br><br>
            All this happens without any extra charges to you.<br><br>
            Isn’t that a relief?</p>

                <h2 class="care-title">The Client Care Package Will Save You Time and Money</h2>
                <p>For a small fee that’s added to your tax preparation invoice, we’ll shield and protect you from ever having to deal with the tax authorities by yourself in the event you get a notice from the IRS or state tax authorities.<br><br>
                And if you ever have to meet with an agent in person, we’ll attend the meeting on your behalf. You don’t even have to go!<br><br>
                You have the option to “opt out” of the plan if you choose; otherwise, you can agree to the protection by paying the fee.<br><br>
                But if you choose to “opt out” of the Client Care Package, you will be charged our usual hourly rates to handle any and all notices you receive from the IRS or State questioning items on your return.</p>
